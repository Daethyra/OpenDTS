# OpenDTS Project Roadmap
### What is it?
I'm in the process of developing a real-time domestic terrorism threat detector, named OpenDTS(Domestic Threat Scanner). It's designed to identify and analyze potential extremist threats by processing various sources of data, with a focus on real-time Twitter data. My goal is to provide insights that can be used to better understand and mitigate these threats.

## Data Collection
First things first, I need to collect the data. I'll be downloading and updating data links related to extremist activities periodically. This will ensure that my data is always up-to-date. Additionally, I'll be extracting real-time Twitter data using a tool called Tweepy. Twitter is a hotbed for live information, and I plan to make the most of it.

## Data Preparation
After collecting the data, I'll get it ready for analysis. This involves cleaning the data, organizing it, and encoding categorical data. It's like preparing ingredients for cooking, but in this case, I'm preparing the data for the 'main dish' - the machine learning models.

## Building and Training Models
With the data prepared, it's time to build and train the machine learning models. These models will be designed to detect and verify potential threats. I'll use a tool called TensorFlow for this process. I'll also be updating the models regularly to make sure they keep up with the latest data trends.

## System Development
Next, I'll build the overall system that ties everything together. This includes developing an API endpoint for developers to access the processed data. I'll also create a web application with a dynamic heatmap. This heatmap will visualize the predicted threats, giving users an intuitive understanding of the situation.

## Testing and Deployment
Once everything's in place, I'll test the models and the system thoroughly. I'll be checking for accuracy, bias, and performance. I'll also conduct security audits to make sure the system is secure. Once I'm happy with everything, I'll deploy the fine-tuned models to Azure, a cloud platform, where they'll be processing potential threats of violence.

## User Engagement
I understand the importance of keeping users engaged. So, I'll develop strategies to keep users interested and involved. This could include regular updates, newsletters, or even creating a community where users can discuss relevant topics. I'll also introduce perks for long-term subscribers to encourage them to stick around.

## Legal Compliance
Given the sensitive nature of the data, it's crucial that I comply with all relevant data privacy laws. I'll make sure the platform is legal and respectful of everyone's privacy.

## Maintenance and Future Planning
Finally, I'll be monitoring the system regularly to ensure it's working as expected. I'll also update the models and system based on changes in the data and improvements in performance. And of course, I'll be planning for the long-term sustainability of the platform.

By the end of this journey, OpenDTS will be a comprehensive platform that provides valuable insights into potential extremist threats. 
*Whether you're a developer, a potential user, or just someone interested in what I'm doing, I hope this gives you a good understanding of the project!*
