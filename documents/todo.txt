1. combine multi-hooker and multi extension converter

2. automate the creation and storage of Ada002's embeddings

3. create langchain, Chain, for dynamic Chain generation from user
# I am creating a natural language processor that helps people understand their enterprise's threat-landscape by providing step by step guidance for vulnerability reconaissance and remediation. 
3a. Create Chain to exclude certain groups, only include certain groups
Only right-wing extremist groups are eligible for data processing.

4. Implement Chain for cybersecurity tools like https://nmap.org/download, https://www.whois.com/whois, 

5. train binary classification model (intended-violence)
a. Collect better training data. Research hateful comments online that imply the intention to commit violence. Then, find examples that are sarcastic to train against creating False Positives further down the line
b. complete preprocessor: requires[sanitization, cleaning, standardization, tokenization, splitting,]
c. revamp or upgrade embeddings.py module
d. revamp or upgrade model_creator.py module
e. test and evaluate CyberSentinel using techniques I learned from Google courses(https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/video-lecture)

6(2a). create similarity query functionality against Pinecone index
6a(2b). create langchain for queries

7. Study AutoGPT's web browser modules; see how adaptable/useful it'd be for this project



000x1. Create Dockerfile
000x2. Create compose.yml
000x3. Automate SetUp process by writing system-level commands in setup.py
000x3a. AND provide detail manual installation guidance in the ReadMe.md
