0:Fones Nothing the Obama gang does is a surprise any longer. Hillary promises (if elected) to continue the 'progress'. Trump, with his gaffes, is a far better bet to do some good things in Obama's nasty wake.
1:GoColtsBlue Name it after a gay pedophile? Not the smartest thing to do. I couldn't care less if he founded the Navy. You don't honor someone like that by naming ANYTHING after them
1:LibertyFreaq You mean the pedophile Harvey Milk? That one? Name a whole ship after a pedophile, wow. 
0:mikekley Being ex-Navy, this is disgusting to me. "Other than honorable" discharge should have eliminated his name from possible choices.
0:sourpickle Coming soon: The USS Micheal Brown
0:TheWhiteDevil @sourpickle The good ship Lollypop?
0:sourpickle @TheWhiteDevil @sourpickle Flying the Rainbow Flag.
0:buffaloguy I guess the Navy doesn't have any more deserving sailors they can honor. This political correctness is going to destroy one of the few remaining government organizations that still have some respect from the public.
0:mikekley @buffaloguy Good comment!
0:Digger70chall @buffaloguy you'll notice Fox didn't bother to mention the earlier ceremony the same day in Camp Pendleton naming a ship after MoH John Basilone (second ship named after him and it's a real warship DDG) Guess that wouldn't play into the narrative though huh?
0:capthis They are also in the process of changing the Navy Fight song from "Anchors Away" to "In The Navy" by the Village People!
1:blue88s Welcome aboard the USS Milk, sailor! Seriously. I think the USS J. Christopher Stevens, the USS Tyrone Woods, the USS Glen Doherty, or the USS Sean Smith...American heroes who died for America instead of for their lifestyle, deviant or not, would be better able stomached. 
0:puleeze Will they make a backdoor deal to get it commissioned?
0:MrBungle1 USNS Harvey Milk. Aft boarding only. 
1:JustSayNOtoDemocrats The muslims will make an extra effort to blow it up
0:MrBungle1 Jeffrey Dahmer was in the Army. How about naming a base after him?
1:JustSayNOtoDemocrats USS PERVERSION
1:MortisDei I don't understand. Isn't the Navy gay enough already?
1:ChristKiller Just like Milk, this ship will be full of sea-men. 
0:daisman Pathetic! If I was in the Navy when the ship comes out, I'd refuse to serve on it! This guy was no military anything, never served! Not a key United States government person, just a local nobody! Pathetic!
0:mikekley @daisman He served in the Navy for 4 years, but was forced out with an "Other than honorable" discharge. Shouldn't we be naming ships after people who received an honorable discharge at the very minimum??
1:SUCHAJOKE USS MILK................. IT'S A FERRY............... I MEAN FAIRY !
0:MrBungle1 Is it going to be crewed by the Village People? 
1:SunnySanSal Fleet Auxiliary General. F.A.G.
1:turtletank So, it's a ship that oils up other ships and hauls away their effluence? I guess, if you have politicians this determined to name a ship after a rumpranger an oiler is the best option.
0:SheltonWA I'll bet San Francisco is watering at the mouth to get it there for Fleet Week.
0:truthishere @SheltonWA it will take a tsunami to wash the taste out of San Fran's bay
0:Tygher Good to see the Conservative hate machine rev up. Keep it up Cons--- you're quickly becoming irrelevant. Or is this the Christ-like behavior you're always talking about?
0:truthishere @Tygher sorry tighter, this is just meanness today, I haven't seen any evangelizing here; must be tomorrow 
0:Tygher @truthishere @Tygher Could you translate that into English for the rest of us?
1:turtletank @Tygher Even if you define your life by a bad habit, it's still a bad habit. To define anyone by a sexual proclivity dismisses their free will out of hand.
0:Windvane60 @Tygher No hatred by us-we just don't like Liberal/Lamocrats,like you.Maybe you should head down to Orlando.
1:whybotherwithliberals How embarrassing for the Navy ....and America. Liberals have gleefully embraced every known perversion and deviance and are angry that sane people refuse to accept their sickness as 'normal'. Liberals - the very worst among us. Liberalism - America's greatest enemy.
1:puleeze They're planning to paint it pink with lace around the deck!
0:stldsf1 @whybotherwithliberals I find the pure hate the flows through the keyboards of the Fox "Christians" to be far more disgusting than anything Harvey Milk ever did
1:turtletank @stldsf1 @whybotherwithliberals Buttsex is a bad habit, not a life style.
0:stldsf1 @turtletank @stldsf1 @whybotherwithliberals Whats it like living in 1912?
0:turtletank @stldsf1 @turtletank @whybotherwithliberals With all the nasty old STDs that are now drug resistant the libidinous are going to learn about chastity the hard way. A shot won't fix it anymore.
0:mikekley @whybotherwithliberals Couldn't agree more. Great comment!
1:ron12 Obama immediately called the Commander of the ship to ask him about the status of the transgender bathrooms.
0:SamPatch @ron12 That wasn't even a good try gomer.
0:casey6511 Harvey died of HIV. So did his partner, I believe.
1:truthishere @casey6511 hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha 
0:Tygher @casey6511 Harvey was shot by a co-worker who hated gays. Even a quick google search would show that. But perhaps you prefer lying?
0:truthishere @Tygher @casey6511 hahahahahahahaha

0:hashman53 I pity the sailors that are assigned to the ship. 
1:truthishere The Iranians will just throw it off of a building when their patrol boats capture it
1:Unidentified743 Welp, I guess this is the end of the US Navy as history has known it previously. It used to be a place where young boys went to learn how to be men. Now I guess it's a place where young gay boys go to meet other young gay boys. We must be a laughing stock. 
0:Tygher @Unidentified743 I don't know about "we," but I'll agree that you're a laughing stock.
0:SamPatch @Unidentified743 Its still the same Navy. Stop being a drama queen.
1:Anthonyhantonh Did the Village people sing at the naming. LOL What a joke.
0:MrBungle1 @anthonyhantonh Yeah that was a big black eye for the Navy when the Village People filmed a homoerotic video on one of their destroyers. 
0:WiltonManors Nothing like a good gay article to bring out the "conservative" dinosaurs. The beauty is - conservatives lost. On gay rights, on your candidates, on everything that counts. Because extremist conservatives are a hate fringe group. Nothing more. 
0:Usmellbad @WiltonManors GFY!!
0:WiltonManors @Usmellbad @WiltonManors I know. Great isn't it.
0:WaterIsWet @WiltonManors Remember Greece and those gays in the second century BC....you regressives . 
0:WiltonManors8 @WaterIsWet @WiltonManors Remember christians and the Roman Empire? When christians took over, the empire fell. 
0:TheImmortalOne @WiltonManors @WaterIsWet That's not even factually accurate lol WTH are you even talking about
1:jeremiah333 @WiltonManors I beg to differ. The Hillary supporters are one huge hate group.
1:TheImmortalOne @WiltonManors So that means you support pedophiles? Way to go lol You must be so proud
1:casey6511 @WiltonManors Gay Rights don't count- sorry!
1:ron12 @WiltonManors Gays are hetero phobic.
0:jackww This is so sad. I can't believe how much our country has imploded in the past eight years. Unfortunately, it looks like more of the same coming up. 
0:ChrisJ2016 @jackww Sure you don't want to go back any further? I am sure this didn't start in the last 8 years, but I see what you're trying to do.
1:Hellisforever1 So this guy was in the Navy and gay. But because he was "really gay" and outspoken we named a Fu_kin ship after him? 
1:TheImmortalOne @Hellisforever1 and he was a pedo
0:Windvane60 Makes me glad I didn't serve aboard a tanker.The USN has really gone down hill.
1:my_thoughts As a Navy Veteran I find this deplorable! What happened to the U.C.M.J. that we were held accountable too? I guess when Bill Clinton came in office and implemented "Don't Tell, Don't Ask" any thing that had to do with homosexuality or beastity went out the window. And now with Obama in office ANYTHING goes. Our once great Country has turned into a cesspool of Liberals.
0:humbled @my_thoughts Liberals who won't serve honorably.

0:dinsmo81 We've never needed someone to make America Great Again more so than right now.
0:WiltonManors @dinsmo81 But Trump isn't a religious fanatical conservative. Do you think he really cares about the anti-gay agenda?

1:reallynoway1 these are the people leading us. people who would light up the white house with the gay flag. people who want our country invaded by sharia law pushing islamists. Obama hated this country and only served to turn it around toward destruction
0:humbled @reallynoway1 No, I think Obama thought he would make this country in his own image.
1:AlanASF Milk has sexual relations with multiple male enlisted men and is forced out of the Navy with a less than honorable discharge. His reward for his unacceptable conduct is he gets a ship named after him for his political activities in San Francisco. No wonder our military is in such a mess.

0:Tygher @humbled @Tygher @Windvane60 @EyeseeIt I woke up in a Soho doorway, a policeman knew my name. He said "You can go sleep at home tonight if you can get up and walk away." I slipped back to the Underground and the breeze blew back my hair. I remember throwing punches around and preaching from my chair. Well, who are you?

0:Windvane60 @Tygher @Windvane60 @EyeseeItUSN,Vietnam combat vet,Mekong.Honorable Discharge,Purple Heart,etc.etc.What's been YOUR service to America,Pogeybait ?
0:TheImmortalOne To all the lying liberals who keep saying he was Honorably discharged. Britannica.com/biography/Harvey-Milk Not according to Harvey he wasn't.
0:SamPatch @TheImmortalOne And military records don't support his claim. Like any politician he was pandering for sympathy and votes.
0:IndictHillary Sorry, Navy, but this is just wrong! There must be numerous homosexuals who have served our country with distinction and not been given a "less than honorable" discharge. The ship could have been named after one of them.
1:dinsmo81 @IndictHillary Or at least ones that didn't openly brag about their pedophilia exploits
0:SamPatch @IndictHillary He was honorably discharged. Go to the United States Naval Institute site and read for yourself.
0:IndictHillary @SamPatch @IndictHillary I will. So, you are saying the the AP is incorrect on that.
0:SamPatch @IndictHillary @SamPatch Yes I am. Have fun.
0:IndictHillary @SamPatch @IndictHillary Interestingly, I find both comments on various site. Honorably and less than honorable. I will hope that the Navy has better presence of mind than naming a ship after someone with a "less than"
0:IndictHillary @SamPatch @IndictHillary That is indeed what the article on the USNI web says. It is not unusual for the AP to be wrong... but usually it favors causes such as this. But, if he was indeed honorably discharged, I apologize to him and withdraw my objection to the ship naming.
0:SamPatch @IndictHillary @SamPatch I really wish there was more info on his Discharge Type as that has fueled a lot of derisive comments, but I have to default with USNI as they are pretty good with getting it right. They also provide info on the article's author at the bottom. Now all that aside, the Navy could have chosen a different vessel than an oiler. The jokes from that will be going around for decades.
0:truthishere @SamPatch @IndictHillary after you pay the $40 to access it I will 
0:SamPatch @truthishere @SamPatch @IndictHillaryWhat are you talking about?
0:humbled This is what happens when you politicize the military and make a social experiment out of it.
0:WiltonManors The comments below (and above) are exactly WHY it is appropriate to name the ship after someone who stood up for civil and human rights.
1:dinsmo81 @WiltonManors And by stood up, you mean kneel in front of a 13 year old boy...
1:hawk0323 @dinsmo81 @WiltonManors Or behind...
0:WiltonManors @dinsmo81 @WiltonManors Ever heard of the republican icon Mark Foley?
0:dinsmo81 @WiltonManors @dinsmo81 No, did someone name a boat after him?
0:WiltonManors @dinsmo81 @WiltonManors Try bobbling him and asking. You are the expert on pedophiles (experience counts).
1:hawk0323 @WiltonManors @dinsmo81 Short answer is, No. They didn't name a boat after him like they are doing for this pedophile.
0:IndictHillary @WiltonManors But who was given a "less than honorable" discharge from the very Navy who is naming the ship after him. I guess THAT doesn't count
0:humbled @WiltonManors I don't disagree with your point of view about the comments, but I can tell you this. If we had people at the top who understood the military because they had served, or had other alliances with it, we would not have such controversial issues.
0:dinsmo81 Our Commander in Chief is on the record as supporting and honoring known pedophiles. When will people say enough already?
0:Tygher @dinsmo81 Your obsession with pedophilia tells me you are a pedophile. Please seek help for your sickness.
0:hawk0323 @Tygher @dinsmo81 Please stick to your day job.........babysitting your mom's basement.
0:Tygher @hawk0323 @Tygher @dinsmo81 I get it, you can't defend your pedophilia, so you're lashing out. Get help.
0:hawk0323 @Tygher @hawk0323 @dinsmo81 You giving out a psychological diagnosis and/or advice is the equivalent of a monkey solving a puzzle for a banana. 
0:Tygher @hawk0323 @Tygher @dinsmo81 Did you enjoy the banana?
0:hawk0323 @Tygher @hawk0323 @dinsmo81 Were you trying to make a gay reference? Or call me a monkey....in which case, you were, AGAIN using my post to try and attack. You really are incapable of coming up with any original thought..
0:Tygher @hawk0323 @Tygher @dinsmo81 Are you really so dense you couldn't figure out what I was saying? I doubt you even got the banana. Poor sad thing!
0:dinsmo81 @Tygher @dinsmo81 So demonizing pedophilia is worse than naming naval ships after a known pedophile? Please explain
0:Tygher @dinsmo81 @Tygher Another one who is obsessed with pedophilia. Keep your kids away from @dinsmo81. Sick and dangerous.
0:Windvane60 @Tygher @dinsmo81 Well,your mental identity is very much open to question,given your postings;right ?
0:dinsmo81 What kind of Commander in Chief would allow this to happen?
1:IndictHillary @dinsmo81 I love rhetorical questions. We all know what kind
1:HistoryRepeatsItself May God send it to the bottom of the sea. Disgusting.
0:IndictHillary "Milk's career as a Navy officer, however, ended with an "other than honorable" discharge," Yup! That's the kind of person we should be naming ships after. And my comment has nothing to do with his preferences, just his performance as a Navy officer. But apparently his preferences have more to do with a ship being named after him than his performance.... as far as the Navy is concerned.
1:GOTRUMPFORAMERICA As a Navy Veteran, I hope that they painted a target on the hull....
0:Justasouthernguy @GOTRUMPFORAMERICA If you were a Veteran you would not say that. Why would you want a bunch of kids put in harms way that had no say in the matter?
0:hawk0323 @Justasouthernguy @GOTRUMPFORAMERICAWell, technically, they do. They just may not be in the military anymore if they speak out. 
1:my_thoughts @Justasouthernguy @GOTRUMPFORAMERICA If you were a Navy Veteran you would understand what GOTRUMPFORAMERICA means by his comments. Naming a ship after a gay that was discharged under other than honorable conditions shows how sick our government and country is.
0:dankat2 The next one will be Margaret Sanger
0:TheImmortalOne @dankat2 SS Sandusky
1:buckneykid Does the ship only go in reverse?
1:hawk0323 @buckneykid It comes with a pitcher, and a catcher mode
1:DMS6922 This will strike fear in our enemies....! They will be afraid they will be rear ended by a ferry boat... 
1:rivrrodent @DMS6922 wellsaid
1:PudbertSavannahGA Are they also going to paint it PINK, color a big brown A55hole by the rudder and paint DIX on the guns ? ? Unfrigginbelievable.
1:usatravler Man it with gays and send to cruise the shores of Iran.....A real threat to their Evinrude navy. Who's going to engineer and make the condom it has to be wrapped in?
0:destindiver1980 Wow... Loss of words.
1:dankat2 I am truly scared of this country now. What have we become? I am not doubting this person may be seen as a person to be recognized for his contribution in history but to name a US Navel Ship this is insane. This country would rather name a ship after a gay right activist then a person of the military maybe a person who died defended America. I am sorry but this is just wrong. It is not the place for reconnection. I don't have an issue with gay's as my grandson is gay but I refuse for them to have more clout then everyone else. A person who is gay should not define them. I think it is respectful to recognize that many have differences but not to award these differences as a power tool. Maybe they should name a ship after my husband who spent 7 1/2 years in the US Navy from 1960-1967.
0:Catmando2015 @dankat2 How does naming a ship after him give gays more clout as you say? The navy decided to name this class of ship after people making significant contributions to civil and human rights. Milk did that for the gay community. There are many other classes of ships named after military personnel.
0:Jmm628 @dankat2 Did your husband become an activist fighting for the equal treatment of others? 
0:Tygher Funny to watch a bunch of Cons who never served criticizing a man who served honorably.
1:dinsmo81 @Tygher Serving up BJ's to little boys isn't "serving honorably"
0:Tygher @dinsmo81 @Tygher I agree, so why do you keep doing it?
1:madcows He was a self admitted pedophile.
0:GOTRUMPFORAMERICA @tygher....other than honorably..read the article queerbait..
0:Tygher @GOTRUMPFORAMERICA Oh, an article on Fox couldn't possibly be wrong. That's hilarious!
0:TheImmortalOne @Tygher Why do you keep lying? He was discharged dishonourably.
0:Tygher @TheImmortalOne @Tygher Why do YOU keep lying?
0:TheImmortalOne @Tygher @TheImmortalOne See I provide my sources. You just lie.
0:Tygher @TheImmortalOne @Tygher You are probably in denial about a lot of things. No surprise there. You're broken. Sad.
0:TheImmortalOne @Tygher @TheImmortalOne I JUST provided you a source. Britannica.com/biography/Harvey-Milk According to Britannica AND Harvey, he received a dishonourable discharge.
0:Tygher @TheImmortalOne @Tygher Is the baby still crying? Aw, don't cry, baby. Mommy will come to change your diaper.
1:TheImmortalOne @Tygher @TheImmortalOne LoL That's what I thought. You get shown that you're supporting a pedophile and you got nothing to say. But like I said, that's what we expect from your ilk.
0:Tygher @TheImmortalOne @Tygher Poor thing, your hatred has melted your brain. Assuming there was a brain to begin with. But it's fun making you dance like a monkey on a chain. Dance, monkey!
0:justinm32 I'm currently serving so take your little smirk and shove it. He didn't serve honorably, which is why he got an other than honorable discharge.
0:Tygher @justinm32 Sure you are, buddy. Sure you are.
0:justinm32 Keep living in denial chickensh!t. I'm totally not sitting in my flightsuit getting ready to go to base. You are so right. You are such a smart little Libby keep telling yourself that you special little flower.
1:Ramtoughtom Hope the pos sinks with all of her don't ask, don't tell sailors on board.
0:Tygher @Ramtoughtom Wishing the death of US military personnel? Sounds like treason to me!
0:rivrrodent @Tygher @Ramtoughtom What would you know about service or treason?
1:rustyhook The USS Qeerbarge
1:rivrrodent Is it really a Navy ship, or just the San Francisco Bay Fairy?
0:destindiver1980 @rivrrodent lol
1:dinsmo81 Honoring pedophiles is long overdue. Does it have to be liberal pedophiles or do other ones get boats too?
0:Tygher @dinsmo81 Yeah, you Cons made a pedophile Speaker of the House! You must be so proud!
0:rivrrodent @Tygher @dinsmo81 That was water-carrying republicans. No conservatives were involved.
0:SamPatch @rivrrodent @Tygher @dinsmo81 LOL.. sure honey. 
0:rivrrodent @SamPatch @rivrrodent @Tygher @dinsmo81 When name-calling starts, you have lost
0:Tygher @rivrrodent @SamPatch @Tygher @dinsmo81 Nope, when you put a pedophile two heartbeats away from the Presidency, you've lost. Nice try, though.
0:rivrrodent @Tygher @rivrrodent @SamPatch @dinsmo81 I agree we have lost, but it was no speaker who destroys our military. It is Barack Obama and his employers.
0:SamPatch @rivrrodent @Tygher @SamPatch @dinsmo81 You are such a drama queen. The military is not "destroyed". 
0:rivrrodent @SamPatch @rivrrodent @Tygher @dinsmo81 I don't believe you have any right to judge the military. When did you serve?
0:SamPatch @rivrrodent @SamPatch @Tygher @dinsmo81 From 1990 to 2012. 
0:rivrrodent @SamPatch @rivrrodent @Tygher @dinsmo81 sure
0:Tygher @rivrrodent @SamPatch @Tygher @dinsmo81 I don't believe you should have made a pedophile Speaker of the House, but you seem to be fine with that. Sad.
1:Justasouthernguy Proof the Navy has a sense of humor. I can here it now. U.S.S. Milk full of seaman enter San Francisco.
