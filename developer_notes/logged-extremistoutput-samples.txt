When a potential threat or extremist content is detected, the script logs a message using the logger.info method. The message includes the tweet ID and the similarity score. Here's what a sample log message might look like:

logger.info(f"Potential threat detected in tweet {status.id_str} with similarity score {match['score']}")




If a tweet with the ID "1234567890" was found to have a similarity score of 0.96, the log message would look like this:

INFO:__main__:Potential threat detected in tweet 1234567890 with similarity score 0.96




And if a potential extremist content was detected, the log message would look like this:

INFO:__main__:Potential extremist content detected in tweet 1234567890 with similarity score 0.96
