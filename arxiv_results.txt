Title: An analysis of replies to Trump's tweets
Authors: Zijian An, Kenneth Joseph
Summary: Donald Trump has tweeted thousands of times during his presidency. These
public statements are an increasingly important way through which Trump
communicates his political and personal views. A better understanding of the
way the American public consumes and responds to these tweets is therefore
critical. In the present work, we address both consumption of and response to
Trump's tweets by studying replies to them on Twitter. With respect to
response, we find that a small number of older, white, left-leaning, and female
Americans are responsible for the vast majority of replies to Trump's tweets.
These individuals also attend to a broader range of Trump's tweets than the
rest of the individuals we study. With respect to consumption, we note that
Trump's tweets are often viewed not in isolation, but rather in the context of
a set of algorithmically-curated replies. These replies may therefore color the
way Americans consume Trump's tweets. To this end, we find some evidence that
Twitter accounts see replies in line with their political leanings. However, we
show that this can be largely, although not entirely, attributed to the fact
that Twitter is more likely to show replies by accounts a user follows. As a
basis for comparison, all results for Trump are compared and contrasted with
replies to Joe Biden's tweets.

Title: Roots of Trumpism: Homophily and Social Feedback in Donald Trump Support
  on Reddit
Authors: Joan Massachs, Corrado Monti, Gianmarco De Francisci Morales, Francesco Bonchi
Summary: We study the emergence of support for Donald Trump in Reddit's political
discussion. With almost 800k subscribers, "r/The_Donald" is one of the largest
communities on Reddit, and one of the main hubs for Trump supporters. It was
created in 2015, shortly after Donald Trump began his presidential campaign. By
using only data from 2012, we predict the likelihood of being a supporter of
Donald Trump in 2016, the year of the last US presidential elections. To
characterize the behavior of Trump supporters, we draw from three different
sociological hypotheses: homophily, social influence, and social feedback. We
operationalize each hypothesis as a set of features for each user, and train
classifiers to predict their participation in r/The_Donald.
  We find that homophily-based and social feedback-based features are the most
predictive signals. Conversely, we do not observe a strong impact of social
influence mechanisms. We also perform an introspection of the best-performing
model to build a "persona" of the typical supporter of Donald Trump on Reddit.
We find evidence that the most prominent traits include a predominance of
masculine interests, a conservative and libertarian political leaning, and
links with politically incorrect and conspiratorial content.

Title: Of Hags and bitches. Ageist attitudes in 2016 presidential debate on
  twitter
Authors: Balcerzak Bartlomiej, Nielek Radoslaw
Summary: In this article we present our exploratory research into the occurrence of
ageist attitudes within the discussion related to the US 2016 presidential
election. We use natural processing techniques to analyze the content tweets
related to Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Content analysis shows that
although ageist attitudes are scarce in the discussion, they are mostly focused
on Hillary Clinton rather than Donald Trump. Also, ageist arguments against
Donald Trump appear mostly as a reply to controversies connected with the
health of Hillary Clinton.

Title: Catching Fire via "Likes": Inferring Topic Preferences of Trump
  Followers on Twitter
Authors: Yu Wang, Jiebo Luo, Richard Niemi, Yuncheng Li, Tianran Hu
Summary: In this paper, we propose a framework to infer the topic preferences of
Donald Trump's followers on Twitter. We first use latent Dirichlet allocation
(LDA) to derive the weighted mixture of topics for each Trump tweet. Then we
use negative binomial regression to model the "likes," with the weights of each
topic serving as explanatory variables. Our study shows that attacking
Democrats such as President Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
earns Trump the most "likes." Our framework of inference is generalizable to
the study of other politicians.

Title: Will Sanders Supporters Jump Ship for Trump? Fine-grained Analysis of
  Twitter Followers
Authors: Yu Wang, Yang Feng, Xiyang Zhang, Richard Niemi, Jiebo Luo
Summary: In this paper, we study the likelihood of Bernie Sanders supporters voting
for Donald Trump instead of Hillary Clinton. Building from a unique time-series
dataset of the three candidates' Twitter followers, which we make public here,
we first study the proportion of Sanders followers who simultaneously follow
Trump (but not Clinton) and how this evolves over time. Then we train a
convolutional neural network to classify the gender of Sanders followers, and
study whether men are more likely to jump ship for Trump than women. Our study
shows that between March and May an increasing proportion of Sanders followers
are following Trump (but not Clinton). The proportion of Sanders followers who
follow Clinton but not Trump has actually decreased. Equally important, our
study suggests that the jumping ship behavior will be affected by gender and
that men are more likely to switch to Trump than women.

Title: Online Political Discourse in the Trump Era
Authors: Rishab Nithyanand, Brian Schaffner, Phillipa Gill
Summary: We identify general trends in the (in)civility and complexity of political
discussions occurring on Reddit between January 2007 and May 2017 -- a period
spanning both terms of Barack Obama's presidency and the first 100 days of
Donald Trump's presidency. We then investigate four factors that are frequently
hypothesized as having contributed to the declining quality of American
political discourse -- (1) the rising popularity of Donald Trump, (2)
increasing polarization and negative partisanship, (3) the democratization of
news media and the rise of fake news, and (4) merging of fringe groups into
mainstream political discussions.

Title: Political elections and uncertainty -Are BRICS markets equally exposed
  to Trump's agenda?
Authors: Jamal Bouoiyour, Refk Selmi
Summary: There certainly is little or no doubt that politicians, sometimes consciously
and sometimes not, exert a significant impact on stock markets. The evolving
volatility over the Republican Donald Trump's surprise victory in the US
presidential election is a perfect example when politicians, through announced
policies, send signals to financial markets. The present paper seeks to address
whether BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) stock markets
equally vulnerable to Trump's plans. For this purpose, two methods were
adopted. The first presents an event-study methodology based on regression
estimation of abnormal returns. The second is based on vote intentions by
integrating data from social media (Twitter), search queries (Google Trends)
and public opinion polls. Our results robustly reveal that although some
markets emerged losers, others took the opposite route. China took the biggest
hit with Brazil, while the damage was much more limited for India and South
Africa. These adverse responses can be explained by the Trump's
neo-mercantilist attitude revolving around tearing up trade deals, instituting
tariffs, and labeling China a "currency manipulator". However, Russia looks to
be benefiting due to Trump's sympathetic attitude towards Vladimir Putin and
expectations about the scaling down of sanctions imposed on Russia over its
role in the conflict in Ukraine.

Title: Ratioing the President: An exploration of public engagement with Obama
  and Trump on Twitter
Authors: Joshua R. Minot, Michael V. Arnold, Thayer Alshaabi, Christopher M. Danforth, Peter Sheridan Dodds
Summary: The past decade has witnessed a marked increase in the use of social media by
politicians, most notably exemplified by the 45th President of the United
States (POTUS), Donald Trump. On Twitter, POTUS messages consistently attract
high levels of engagement as measured by likes, retweets, and replies. Here, we
quantify the balance of these activities, also known as "ratios", and study
their dynamics as a proxy for collective political engagement in response to
presidential communications. We find that raw activity counts increase during
the period leading up to the 2016 election, accompanied by a regime change in
the ratio of retweets-to-replies connected to the transition between
campaigning and governing. For the Trump account, we find words related to fake
news and the Mueller inquiry are more common in tweets with a high number of
replies relative to retweets. Finally, we find that Barack Obama consistently
received a higher retweet-to-reply ratio than Donald Trump. These results
suggest Trump's Twitter posts are more often controversial and subject to
enduring engagement as a given news cycle unfolds.

Title: Voting with Feet: Who are Leaving Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump?
Authors: Yu Wang, Yuncheng Li, Quanzeng You, Xiyang Zhang, Richard Niemi, Jiebo Luo
Summary: From a crowded field with 17 candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump
have emerged as the two front-runners in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.
The two candidates each boast more than 5 million followers on Twitter, and at
the same time both have witnessed hundreds of thousands of people leave their
camps. In this paper we attempt to characterize individuals who have left
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump between September 2015 and March 2016.
  Our study focuses on three dimensions of social demographics: social capital,
gender, and age. Within each camp, we compare the characteristics of the
current followers with former followers, i.e., individuals who have left since
September 2015. We use the number of followers to measure social capital, and
profile images to infer gender and age. For classifying gender, we train a
convolutional neural network (CNN). For age, we use the Face++ API.
  Our study shows that for both candidates followers with more social capital
are more likely to leave (or switch camps). For both candidates females make up
a larger presence among unfollowers than among current followers. Somewhat
surprisingly, the effect is particularly pronounced for Clinton. Lastly,
middle-aged individuals are more likely to leave Trump, and the young are more
likely to leave Hillary Clinton.

Title: Twitter's Agenda-Setting Role: A Study of Twitter Strategy for Political
  Diversion
Authors: Yuyang Chen, Xiaoyu Cui, Yunjie Song, Manli Wu
Summary: This study verified the effectiveness of Donald Trump's Twitter campaign in
guiding agen-da-setting and deflecting political risk and examined Trump's
Twitter communication strategy and explores the communication effects of his
tweet content during Covid-19 pandemic. We collected all tweets posted by Trump
on the Twitter platform from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.We used
Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis with a fixed effects model to
analyze the existence of the Twitter strategy. The correlation between the
number of con-firmed daily Covid-19 diagnoses and the number of particular
thematic tweets was investigated using time series analysis. Empirical analysis
revealed Twitter's strategy is used to divert public attention from negative
Covid-19 reports during the epidemic, and it posts a powerful political
communication effect on Twitter. However, findings suggest that Trump did not
use false claims to divert political risk and shape public opinion.
