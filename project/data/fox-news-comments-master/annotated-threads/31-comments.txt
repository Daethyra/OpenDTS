0:slumdogpreacher Now we have reverse discrimination, BIG TIME because of this PERCEIVED PROBLEM that our DEAR LEADER intended to remedy by EXECUTIVE FIAT! Just another reason why there should not be a federal department of education that doles out OUR OWN TAX MONEY and makes the states JUMP THROUGH HOOPS TO GET IT! Don't you think ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!
0:Andrew917 Transgender people have existed since the beginning of time. Some have just always kept the fact that they felt they were the wrong gender a secret and suffered in silence. Others actually lived as the other gender often after moving to a new location. Obviously they used the bathroom of the gender they were living as and no one knew, because unlike Christian Conservatives they didn't go into bathrooms or dressing areas flailing their gen italia around. But now that it's 2016, all of a sudden it's a problem. Why? Politics. And the awareness that these people exist.
0:wayne230 @Andrew917 but CHRISTIANS are the only reason why you care about gays or tgs you want them in all of our churches . of have us pay a huge fine right? that is your equal rights
0:SB117 @wayne230 @Andrew917 Think for yourself for once.
0:wayne230 @SB117 @wayne230 @Andrew917 I always do there is no bigger lie than equal rights for all
0:SB117 @wayne230 @SB117 @Andrew917 You're becoming far too repetitive.
0:wayne230 @SB117 @wayne230 @Andrew917 you never do that Sharon?
0:SB117 @wayne230 @SB117 @Andrew917 Honestly, who is Sharon? I don't get the joke.
0:wayne230 @SB117 @wayne230 @Andrew917 so far thats you
0:SB117 @wayne230 @SB117 @Andrew917 You think my name is Sharon? OK? 
0:wayne230 @SB117 @wayne230 @Andrew917 glad you told us your name
0:SB117 @wayne230 @SB117 @Andrew917 Seeing as that's not my name, nor did I ever say it was, I still have no idea what you're trying to say.
0:wayne230 @SB117 @wayne230 @Andrew917 you just now said it was
0:SB117 @wayne230 @SB117 @Andrew917 Well no, I didn't. So again, what in the world are you saying?
0:wayne230 @SB117 @wayne230 @Andrew917 its nice to know your real name. its a pretty female name
0:SB117 @wayne230 @SB117 @Andrew917 Ah, okay. You wish I was a woman. That's cr⁠e⁠epy, Wayne. Keep your fan⁠tas⁠ies to yourself.
1:wayne230 @SB117 @wayne230 @Andrew917 so you admit being a woman?
0:SB117 @wayne230 @SB117 @Andrew917 You've made it quite clear you're hoping I'm a woman. That's sa⁠d, Wayne. You need help.
0:Andrew917 @SB117 @wayne230 @Andrew917 I came back to my post and saw "16 replies" and actually thought "Wow, maybe my post generated some interesting conversation." Then I clicked on it. OMG. Sharon was probably his third wife...and second daughter.
0:SB117 @Andrew917 @SB117 @wayne230 Nah, he didn't come up with that one himself either.@cuss did and he's been parroting it. Like I said, he's not capable of an original thought.
0:LarJass @SB117 @Andrew917 @wayne230 He's not capable of any thought, period!
0:wayne230 @LarJass @SB117 @Andrew917 @wayne230 none that is a vote for Hilary
0:Andrew917 @wayne230 @Andrew917 Republicans en masse are getting ready to turn their back on Trump the way they did on Bob Dole in '96 when it was clear he couldn't win against Bill Clinton.
0:wayne230 @Andrew917 @wayne230 no the opposite your polls poll mostly Democrats who can't stand Hilary who matters because of that cigar
0:Andrew917 @wayne230 @Andrew917 The polls are accurate Wayne. Pollsters compete with each other for contracts and as a result focus on accuracy. They have no problem predicting elections within the margin of error. A couple like Fox and Rasmussen have a Republican house effect of around 3 points. A couple like PPP have a Dem house effect of around 3. The polls say Trump isn't doing very well. Worse than they said McCain and Romney were doing at this same time. EVEN Fox's polls.
0:wayne230 @Andrew917 @wayne230 why does that Neke Silver say that Trump will win by 57 percent?? they can easily find Democrats in Manhattans. but they don't like Hilary at all not many do
1:ProfessorHeisenberg If Trump ever endorses violence against liberals, I will comply with his wishes, gladly.
1:wayne230 @ProfessorHeisenberg I think we all will come Nov 8
0:SB117 @wayne230 @ProfessorHeisenberg This is why you need help. You need to be in asylum before you hurt someone.
0:wayne230 @SB117 @wayne230 @ProfessorHeisenberg you do since I thought you did not like HRC that is a lie obviously
0:SB117 @wayne230 @SB117 @ProfessorHeisenberg Hopefully the authorities come for you before election day.
0:Andrew917 @ProfessorHeisenberg The latest projections are the Orange Clown loses in a landslide.
0:SB117 @Andrew917 @ProfessorHeisenberg Here's hoping he brings as many Republicans down with him as possible.
0:wayne230 @SB117 @Andrew917 @ProfessorHeisenberg nope the Dems will dump Hilary like they dumped Carter in 80
0:SB117 @wayne230 @SB117 @Andrew917 @ProfessorHeisenberg Source?
0:Andrew917 @wayne230 @SB117 @Andrew917 @ProfessorHeisenberg They dumped Carter because he couldn't resolve the hostage crisis and inflation was out of control...after he was in office four years. Now why are they going to dump Hillary?
0:SB117 @Andrew917 @wayne230 @SB117 @ProfessorHeisenberg His overlords haven't told him that one yet.
0:SB117 @Andrew917 @wayne230 @SB117 @ProfessorHeisenberg See what I mean? No answer, just repetition of the original statement.
0:wayne230 @SB117 @Andrew917 @wayne230 @ProfessorHeisenberg nope a VOTE for hilary is what your only answer would be
0:SB117 @wayne230 @SB117 @Andrew917 @ProfessorHeisenberg No, any answer to the question would be a fine answer.
1:wayne230 @Andrew917 @wayne230 @SB117 @ProfessorHeisenberg nope because the Dems rejected Carter and will do the same to Hilary. they want no more four years of Monica Lewinski
1:Andrew917 @wayne230 @Andrew917 @SB117 @ProfessorHeisenberg Monica Lewinski lol.
0:wayne230 @Andrew917 @wayne230 @SB117 @ProfessorHeisenberg why not? she is why Hilary matters
1:ProfessorHeisenberg Liberals can't distinguish men from women. Nor do they want to.
1:Andrew917 @ProfessorHeisenberg Cons can't distinguish morality from the rantings of a barbaric ancient middle eastern desert tribe.
0:wayne230 @Andrew917 @ProfessorHeisenberg and liberals use that same book and blast Christians day and night falsely
0:AlienNation Freedomscout thinks the public schools are like Pink Floyd's The Wall.
0:SB117 @AlienNation I wish he'd publish his book already and stop spamming here.
0:wayne230 @AlienNation and the left wants homeschooling banned. :)
0:AlienNation @wayne230 @AlienNation Not me.
0:SB117 @AlienNation @wayne230 He's just spouting off the nonsense he hears on TV. He's not capable of critical thought.
0:Andrew917 @SB117 @AlienNation @wayne230 Or it was conservative talk radio. A caller into Han nity says it and Han nity says "Oh you're right. You're right." And then they run around to friends and family wringing their hands as the repeat it as fact.
0:SB117 @Andrew917 @SB117 @AlienNation @wayne230 Given small handful of names that appear in Wayne's tweets, it's definitely FOX.
0:wayne230 @AlienNation @wayne230 I know SB (sharon) does
0:AlienNation @wayne230 @AlienNation I would like to see the quote.
0:SB117 @AlienNation @wayne230 Don't hold your breath.
0:AlienNation @SB117 @AlienNation @wayne230Freedomscout just replied to me below. Read it if you dare. It's so sad.
1:SB117 @AlienNation @SB117 @wayne230 I don't bother reading his posts. Everything coming from a creationist is nonsense.
0:SB117 @wayne230 @AlienNation I wonder which of your favorite talking heads just said that on TV.
0:mdr1975 @freedomscout @rxwhitmer I agree that people should use the public bathroom that fits their actual gender, but what harm to society is caused by someone being transgender?
1:freedomscout The ones harmed the most are the children who are taught in government schooling that "transgenderism" is a valid description of a true reality. First, the very fact that "transgenderism" is not a true reality in itself but a condition of mind makes the claim of validity false...thus being deceptive for the children, youth, adolescents and adults who are deceived by it. Deception about anything critically important in the learning, growth, self-understanding and self-appreciation, and view of the civil society is evil and must be refused and refuted. To confuse children and youth, especially on the issues of their own nature is inexcusable and abusive to them. Because the falsehoods regarding "transgenderism" are being foisted on the culture by intention and willing complicity, the evil effects are widespread and become repeated in social media of all kinds.The result for stability of family and civil society is degradation of both.
0:MollyPitcher1776 @freedomscout @rxwhitmer Seriously, your denial of transgenderism as a "real thing" is quite dangerous as is the condemnation of anyone who is struggli g with identity issues because they are born that way or develop differently due to hormones and biology.
1:Freedomscout @MollyPitcher1776 Transgenderism is just that, an "ism", meaning it is a condition of mind not based on reality. So when I say "real thing" I'm referring to the reality that such a person is confused because they think in their minds they are something which they are not in reality. Condemnation of such confused people isn't appropriate though either, precisely because they are confused and their inner motivations which bring on that confusion are something they don't understand themselves.
0:mdr1975 @freedomscout @rxwhitmer "Trangenderism" is real. Does it mean someone's gender has actually changed? No, but that doesn't make it less real. You mention evil effects. What are they? Be specific, not just something like it's evil or wrong.
1:freedomscout @mdr1975 To call some confusion of mind "real" distorts the discussion, as I tried to make clear that the confusion phenomena is real, i.e. that the person is really confused. So what is real is in opposition to what the confused person believes is real. When I refer to "evil" effects, I'm not using the term generically very often but to indicate a moral form of something that is inherently evil. However, I suspect you are looking for the human consequences that are harmful to the subject (victim) and to families and civil society. Is that the case?
0:mdr1975 @freedomscout @mdr1975 Either way. Yes, how does it harm the individual and society? And, generically, what makes it inherently evil?
0:freedomscout @mdr1975 The harm to the person who is confused about their own sexuality should be obvious, but sadly political correctness has suppressed much of the truth about it. On the face of it, it's inherently harmful for a person to be confused about anything where reality is involved, because the confusion causes them to react to reality erroneously, making decisions that are, at least, not in their best interest and that are, at worst, very harmful to their lives and wellbeing.
0:AlienNation @freedomscout @mdr1975 How will you go about "curing" them? They have tried many different kinds of therapy with them. The only best solution for now is to help them transition. Forcing them to be "normal" will have them end up in depression, various problems and possibly suicide.
0:AlienNation @freedomscout @mdr1975 Also they are not "confused" as they are well aware of their own bodies.
1:freedomscout @AlienNation There is a common misconception that one can somehow "force" a confused person out of their confusion. That seldom works, although there are some conditions where various forms of coercion may be effective...and may raise ethical concerns.Transgenderism, like all of the other sexual confusions and perversions, is inherently depressive to the individual, with other inner self harmful effects also...sometimes resulting in suicide. These are all very sad effects and consequences...and need core inner remedies not pandering, sheltering or accommodating. These confusions and perversions are inherently mental, not sourced in the physical nature itself...speaking generally and referring to the great majority of cases. The problem with most of psychology is that it categorizes "mental" as physical, of the brain, instead of the "mind". That's why secular psychology has no answers for these conditions, as permanent correction of the core cause. However, well versed psychologists and counselors who understand the mind as being part of the core spirit nature of the human being, human person, treat the person very differently, with an understanding of volition which dynamically changes the process of treatment and dynamically results in core therapy and lasting benefit, true healing of the person to live normally as they truly are in harmony with their physical self.
0:AlienNation @freedomscout @AlienNation Again you have not given any viable solution. The "spiritual counseling" have been done many times before. The depression comes from the fact that people like you will not accept them as who they are and instead want to force them to conform to what is your idea of reality.
1:Freedomscout @AlienNation The depression doesn't come from outside for these persons, but from their inner confusion about their own nature and value. It can be accentuated by outside influence that is demeaning, of course. But the depression source is internal to the person themselves, and is alleviated when they come to understand some core concepts about their nature as human persons as well as their physical nature. I suppose that what you conceive as "spiritual counselling" is simplistic recitation of Scripture and platitudes, along with sessions of prayer, etc. What I'm actually referring to is very deep counseling, working inward from the objective self-concepts of the person as God's created being of immense worth and value, to both God and the rest of humanity. But the subject does not easily acclimate to these concepts when they are so confused. It takes a great deal of patience and explanation on various levels of understanding that fit the subject's own initial perceptions and beliefs, helping them to understand where they are in error in their concepts and understanding...and why their understanding is erroneous. Essential in this process is the understanding imparted to the subject that they can choose to believe differently, and choose to redirect their own thinking patterns, actually modifying their brain structure over time. The resulting symbiosis between purposed thought and changes in the brain result in true long lasting, permanent, healing.
0:mdr1975 @freedomscout @mdr1975 Seems like general statements again. What is so obviously wrong or evil about it. What actual harm is being caused by their choices?
0:AlienNation "Indeed there are those who are last who will be first, and first who will be last." - Luke 13:30 Guess who will be last in heaven?
0:mdr1975 @AlienNation No one?
0:AlienNation @mdr1975 @AlienNation No one as in nobody is answering or no one as in nobody is going to be last in heaven despite what Jesus said?
0:mdr1975 @AlienNation @mdr1975 No one, as in my guess is no one.
0:MollyPitcher1776 @AlienNation I will be last if you just need someone to close up shop. Does room service exist in Heavan? I hope it is a fun place and not just a bunch of religious nuts praying and such.
0:Freedomscout @MollyPitcher1776 Oh it's going to be a fun place all right. So, as Jesus said earlier in this chapter, " “Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to."
0:Andrew917 @rxwhitmer So you think it's moral to discriminate against transgender people when science, medicine and psychology all say their condition is legitimate? On what basis?
1:freedomscout Here we see a rationale commonly used by those who support these bizarre behaviors and policies. First, the terms "discriminate" and "discrimination" are elevated in their minds to the level of a religious sanctimony, as though they were ultimate weapons of warfare against those who oppose these foolish notions. The idea is to intimidate the opposition with these terms to make them feel guilty of some wrong or evil, or at least make them feel unaccepted for who they are in their politically incorrect belief. Then these supporters of fallacy use a blatant fallacy to try to further intimidate any opposition...as in this case making the outrageously fallacious claim, "science, medicine and psychology all say their condition is legitimate". This is supposed intimidate the realists by putting them on the defensive, as though it was their job to refute the grand fallacy, instead of the promoter of the fallacy's job to defend it. Then, the tactic includes a question, which is supposed to imply that the writer is open minded rather than dogmatic and doctrinaire, which they are. Also the question is usually very open ended so that the answer will not like refute anything the writer has claimed, thus diverting attention from the utter fallacy and attempted intimidation to "put the monkey" on the back of the opposition. The way to refute these tactics is to speak the truth, even if it is simply put without a lot of facts and figures and arguments...the simple truth. Of course, one can also engage in presentation of facts, figures and arguments which help other readers/listeners learn the deeper proofs for the truth. So, the truth here is that it is righteous to discriminate between righteousness and evil, right and wrong, good and bad, and tell the truth about it. And the truth is that sexual confusions and perversions are a great harm to their subjects and our civil society if tolerated instead of dealt with properly with the Loving Righteousness of God.
0:LarJass @freedomscout @rxwhitmer How will it harm our "civil society"? Be specific, now.
0:LarJass @freedomscout @rxwhitmer Did you not understand the question?
0:mdr1975 @freedomscout @rxwhitmer I agree that people should use the public bathroom that fits their actual gender, but what harm to society is caused by someone being transgender?
0:LarJass @mdr1975 @freedomscout @rxwhitmer I think he's stumped on that one.
0:mdr1975 @LarJass @mdr1975 @freedomscout @rxwhitmer Seems so.
0:AlienNation @freedomscout @rxwhitmer First, the terms "discriminate" and "discrimination" are elevated in their minds to the level of a religious sanctimony – Freedomscout "Indeed there are those who are last who will be first, and first who will be last." - Luke 13:30 "Do to others as you would have them do to you." - Luke 6:31 Freedomscout, you need to heed to Jesus' words about how you treat other people.
0:MollyPitcher1776 @AlienNation @freedomscout @rxwhitmer I try to live by that "Do unto others" bit.
1:wayne230 @MollyPitcher1776 @AlienNation @freedomscout @rxwhitmer which "other people?" that has a hidden meaning and means HOMOSEXUALS. we see that the left faith ISLAM never had to be kind to "others" in Orlando did they? it depends a LOT on the religion. we watched while 102 "others" got shot in a bar yet we get sued over a cake! that VERY selective morality would make Jesus angry.
1:rxwhitmer Of all the sick moves Obama has made, this has to be the top! He seems to think that as president, the people MUST sereve HIM, not that he should be serving the PEOPLE. The only people he seems to feel obligated to serve are those without morals, which he apparently feels he is part of! Even though he only has a few months left in his term, the house and senate should be calling themselves back into session and impeaching him! Under Obama and Clinton this country has become an immoral, dirtier than dirt nation! I suggest he send his children to a public school affected by this despotic rule! Just to show us how much he believes it!
0:Andrew917 @rxwhitmer So you think it's moral to discriminate against transgender people when science, medicine and psychology all say their condition is legitimate? On what basis?
1:lgrngreen @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer So you think it is fine to protect the rights of immoral people while taking the rights from innocent women to have their privacy?
0:Andrew917 @lgrngreen @Andrew917 @rxwhitmerImmoral people? Who?
1:lgrngreen @Andrew917 @lgrngreen @rxwhitmerTransgender that is who.
0:Andrew917 @lgrngreen @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer If you don't understand what transgender is, go talk to your family doctor. They cover it in medical school.
1:lgrngreen @Andrew917 @lgrngreen @rxwhitmer I understand completely who they are. You are the one that has bought into the lie that they were born with some genetic defect. Transgender is a sick perversion. 
0:LarJass @lgrngreen @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer Transgenders are immoral? That's news to me. I personally know two and they're not immoral.
0:lgrngreen @LarJass @lgrngreen @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer Like your morals don't fall into question by supporting this.
0:LarJass @lgrngreen @LarJass @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer Why should they?
1:lgrngreen @LarJass @lgrngreen @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer Simply because people like you are out to change what is considered moral into something that isn't.
0:LarJass @lgrngreen @LarJass @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer By whose definition? Yours only?
0:lgrngreen @LarJass @lgrngreen @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer No by the standard that has been around since this country was founded and before.
0:Andrew917 @lgrngreen @LarJass @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer No by the standard that has been around since this country was founded and before. So I guess you think we should still have sla very? I'm not surprised. It's biblical too.
0:lgrngreen @Andrew917 @lgrngreen @LarJass @rxwhitmer Nice tactic to switch the conversation.
0:Andrew917 @lgrngreen @Andrew917 @LarJass @rxwhitmer I'm just identifying exactly where your so called morals are coming from.
0:lgrngreen @Andrew917 @lgrngreen @LarJass @rxwhitmer Not hardly.
0:Andrew917 @lgrngreen @Andrew917 @LarJass @rxwhitmer Oh really? Then where?
0:lgrngreen @Andrew917 @lgrngreen @LarJass @rxwhitmer Your interpretation of the Bible is flawed so making you understand anything from it will never happen until you recognize your need for a savior. 
0:Andrew917 @lgrngreen @Andrew917 @LarJass @rxwhitmer So you admit it. Your morality is coming from the bible and not science or medicine. Thank you for making my point.
0:LarJass @Andrew917 @lgrngreen @LarJass @rxwhitmer So his morality is based on what was prevalent in the Middle East about 2000 years ago. Nothing like keeping up to date, eh?
0:Andrew917 @LarJass @Andrew917 @lgrngreen @rxwhitmer Notice how she took off when it came down to actually having to defend God's Word.
0:LarJass @Andrew917 @LarJass @lgrngreen @rxwhitmer Yep!
1:wayne230 @Andrew917 @lgrngreen @LarJass @rxwhitmer its where YOURS comes from too the Bible is why you push TG and gays its a lot more than a book
0:Andrew917 @lgrngreen @Andrew917 @LarJass @rxwhitmer Deuteronomy 22:28 If a man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and r@pes her and they are discovered, 29 he shall pay her father fifty shekels of silver. He must marry the young woman, for he has violated her. He can never divorce her as long as he lives.
0:Andrew917 @lgrngreen @Andrew917 @LarJass @rxwhitmer Leviticus 25:44 “‘Your male and female sla ves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy sla ves. 45 You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property. 46 You can bequeath them to your children as inherited property and can make them sla ves for life, but you must not rule over your fellow Israelites ruthlessly. 
1:wayne230 @Andrew917 @lgrngreen @LarJass @rxwhitmer JEWISH LAWS they don't do that. but you care about the return of slavery via gay marriage
0:Andrew917 @lgrngreen @Andrew917 @LarJass @rxwhitmer Exodus 21:20 “Anyone who beats their male or female sla ve with a rod must be punished if the sla ve dies as a direct result, 21 but they are not to be punished if the sla ve recovers after a day or two, since the sla ve is their property.
1:wayne230 @Andrew917 @lgrngreen @LarJass @rxwhitmer your faith ISLAM is far worse toward slaves than we are
0:LarJass @lgrngreen @Andrew917 @LarJass @rxwhitmer Where do they come from, then?
0:Andrew917 @lgrngreen @LarJass @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer Like your morals don't fall into question by getting your info about human se xuality and gender identity from a barbaric ancient middle eastern desert tribe that had no problem with adults marrying children and thought the appropriate way to deal with ra pe was to make the ra pist marry the victim.
0:LarJass @Andrew917 @lgrngreen @LarJass @rxwhitmer Or stone the victim.
1:wayne230 @LarJass @Andrew917 @lgrngreen @rxwhitmer like Muslims do already
0:mdr1975 @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer Discriminate against them in what way?
0:Andrew917 @mdr1975 @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer By telling them they can't use the bathroom or facilities of the gender that they're living as and under medical and mental health guidance to live as...as they have been for decades.
1:mdr1975 @Andrew917 @mdr1975 @rxwhitmerHaving someone use the bathroom of their actual gender is not discrimination. A man who identifies as a woman (or vice versa) does not mean he is a woman.
0:Andrew917 @mdr1975 @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer Except that that's not their actual gender. They're the gender they're living as.
1:mdr1975 @Andrew917 @mdr1975 @rxwhitmerGender is not a choice. You're born male or female. It doesn't change because you think your the opposite.
0:LarJass @mdr1975 It's "you're," You write like a fifth-grader. And sound like one as well.
0:mdr1975 @LarJass @mdr1975 Good job, you caught a typo to point out since you don't have a counter argument.
0:LarJass @mdr1975 @LarJass It wasn't a typo. You don't know the difference.
0:mdr1975 @LarJass @mdr1975 That doesn't make sense. If I know the difference between the two words, but used the wrong one, that is a typo. This isn't a college paper, I'm not proofreading or checking for auto correct issues. Again, I notice no counter argument from you on the actual post though.
0:LarJass @mdr1975 @LarJass How can I possibly make an understandable counter argument to someone that doesn't know the difference between "your" and "you're"? I just can't du﻿m﻿b it down enough.
0:mdr1975 @LarJass @mdr1975 And you can't understand a typo. Or just hide behind that claim since you can't argue the point, which is more likely in this case. 
0:LarJass @mdr1975 @LarJass Ha ha!!
0:Andrew917 @mdr1975 @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer Ask your family doctor about it. They'll explain it to you.
1:mdr1975 @Andrew917 @mdr1975 @rxwhitmer It's pretty simple. A woman does not change into a man by thinking it. She is still a woman. No issue with her thinking/acting like a man, but that isn't what she is, physically. 
1:wayne230 @mdr1975 @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer join Islam SHOOT the TGs/gays problem solved they get to discriminate against whoever they want to
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer ?
0:wayne230 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer No answer huh? there is no way you are for equal rights
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer no answer? You didn't ask a question.
0:wayne230 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer I did make a statement. I admit that
1:wayne230 @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer ITS PERFECTLY OKAY DEPENDING ON THE RELIGION the liberal faith militant Islam gets to shoot all the TG/s gays it wants to and be protected under Sharia Law
1:freedomscout @rxwhitmer While I empathize with the sentiment and agree that Obama's motives are evil, the long standing evil of murderous abortion has been a terrible part of the moral decadence in America for 43 years now. But even that has been a symptom of the inner decay in the lives of so many people who have lost the moral compass that used to guide our culture.
0:freedomscout The added confusion this is all bringing to children, youth, adolescents and young adults is tragic and so unnecessary. Parents are having a very difficult time shielding their children from the foolish influences of our culture that is creating so much uncertainty and relativism in the minds of youth...largely through social media and sadly through government schooling.
0:Andrew917 @freedomscout - The confusion is added by people following an ancient mythology that have no respect for science, medicine and psychology.
0:freedomscout @Andrew917 How does that have anything to do with it?
1:LarJass @freedomscout @Andrew917 Religion poisons the minds of children against logic and truth.
1:freedomscout @LarJass Many religions are poisonous to logic and truth, that much is true...and human beings still remain fallen human beings even they are Redeemed by the Sacrifice of Jesus Christ. So there's that. But the fallacies of thinking cannot be limited or attributed to religion but to error inherent in human motivation, the motivation to utter self-centeredness as fallen sinful human beings. Nearly all of the world's many religions are expressions of that utter sinful nature...Christianity and Judaism being the sole exceptions.
0:LarJass @freedomscout @LarJass Your comment was correct...except for the last seven words.
0:freedomscout @LarJass I stand by all of them.
0:LarJass @freedomscout @LarJass Sure you do. And you look like a fo﻿ol.
0:freedomscout @LarJass I identify with Paul the Apostle, glad to be called a fool for Jesus Christ.
0:LarJass @freedomscout @LarJass You're just a fo﻿ol...period.
1:freedomscout The saddest result, perhaps, of these political machinations is that children will be influenced to doubt what and who they really are as God's Grand Creation with Inestimable Value.
0:LarJass @freedomscout Is that any worse than the nonsense in the bible?
0:freedomscout @LarJass Since there isn't any nonsense in the Bible, these things surely are worse.
0:LarJass @freedomscout @LarJass No nonsense in the bible? That's funny, scouty!!
0:wayne230 @LarJass @freedomscout None at all and you KNOW it or you would not misquote it
0:MollyPitcher1776 @freedomscout I figured it out by age 5. The good thing is children will have access to healthcare, information, medicine, treatment and support. None of which existed for transexuals when I was a little girl growing up in the 1970's and 80's.
1:ProfessorHeisenberg What a sick, Satan possessed world we live in.
0:freedomscout @ProfessorHeisenberg Stand by for it to get much worse.
0:mdr1975 @ProfessorHeisenberg The world is not possessed by satan.
0:wayne230 @mdr1975 @ProfessorHeisenberg sure it is unless you are on the side of ISIS
1:ProfessorHeisenberg Thankfully Obama is the first and last gay president. Not to mention black.
0:ProfessorHeisenberg Just because Obama wants to pee in the ladies room doesn't mean the rest of America has to put up with it.
0:SB117 That's an odd fantasy.
0:wayne230 @SB117 you want to watch obama pee? YOU are sick
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @SB117 What are you talking about?
0:wayne230 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @SB117 still pushing for yes on TG/gays?
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @SB117 Again, what are you talking about? Who said they wanted to watch Obama pee? And, who is pushing you to say on TG/gays?
1:wayne230 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @SB117 you do and so does SB its about FORCED deviance without that no sense would be possible 
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @SB117 I can't speak for SB, but I don't want to watch anyone pee, nor do I care if you (or anyone else) watches someone else pee.
0:wayne230 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @SB117 fine then lets leave the bathrooms alone
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @SB117 When have I said to mess with a bathroom?
0:wayne230 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @SB117 you asked what I was talking about did you not? which really meant change the bathrooms
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @SB117 No, you asked who wants to see Obama pee. I then asked what are you talking about, because no one had said they want to watch him pee.
1:wayne230 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @SB117 I think you do but its about forced perversion or else
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @SB117 Again, claiming things I've never said
1:wayne230 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @SB117 nothing EVER is said but pro perversion
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @SB117 So, what you say is pro perversion then?
1:wayne230 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @SB117 why else do you want sense from me? what you need is AGREEMENT with a sick lifestyle SOCIALISMLESS @SB117 for liberals ... that is normal
1:WisdomKitty Could this be the real reason, as to why Ms. Clinton basically stopped wearing dresses and pantyhose? Could she possibly have possessed the wisdom to determine what a high-risk liability it would be, having pantyhose entangled about her ankles, as an unknown man entered the ladies room with her, unbeknownst, or did Mr. Clinton simply forewarn her, as to the potential danger? Will the left seek to ban ladies from wearing pantyhose, next, and maybe even dresses, deeming such to be an unnecessary risk within the ladies room?
0:SB117 @WisdomKitty 0/10
0:Andrew917 @WisdomKitty -1/10
0:wayne230 @WisdomKitty her first move God forbid will be to ban dresses
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @WisdomKitty Yeah, a real danger that will happen, I'm sure.
0:wayne230 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @WisdomKittyyou want men wearing dresses not me
0:SB117 You have a very active imagination.
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @WisdomKitty Do I want men wearing dresses? No, but not freaked out by it either.
1:wayne230 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @WisdomKittyme either but that will be the next drug
0:SB117 You forgot to take yours, clearly...
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @WisdomKittyWhat will be the next drug?
1:wayne230 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @WisdomKittytransgenders already is since the court failed to require churches to marry gays
0:SB117 You need a gibberish->English translator to understand any of his posts.
0:mdr1975 @SB117 I do right now because these post aren't making any sense. 
0:SB117 As is usually the case with Wayne.
1:wayne230 @mdr1975 @SB117 Laugh only a pro gay/TG post would EVER make sense to you stop the no sense lie!
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @SB117 No, seriously read your post. It didn't make any sense. Not even talking the opinion it stated. Referring to the phrasing.
0:wayne230 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @SB117 lie you are redefining sense to mean disagreement
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @SB117 No, I'm trying to figure out what you are saying. You're asking questions claiming someone wants stuff they haven't mentioned. 
1:wayne230 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @SB117 not at all you are desperately pushing for a pro deviant answer from me nothing else can make sense but that.its an old liberal game I see all the time unless I say yes to gay marriage and TG bathrooms I can never make sense to you
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @SB117 I just want you to make sense. You're saying stuff like transgenders are the new drug. Be against gays and transgender people all you want, but please make sense when you write so others can understand you.
0:wayne230 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @SB117 Not at all you want me to agree with gays and TGs or it will be impossible to make sense to you its a tiresome liberal game that can never allow different opinions
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @SB117 Another claim of something I've never said. I am fine with you not agreeing with or liking gays or transgenders, and have never said otherwise. People can have different opinions. 
0:nonstopca @mdr1975 @wayne230 @WisdomKittyMaybe you aren't...but I am....
0:mdr1975 @nonstopca1 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @WisdomKitty Why?
0:rxwhitmer @WisdomKitty Actually, the reason she wears pants suits is to better hide the fact she's wearing depends and they might leak!
0:WisdomKitty @rxwhitmer Such is a plausible hypothesis, and if true, perhaps they are customized with body enhancements; nevertheless, she and her party are attacking women, via the Alinsky playbook. 
0:Andrew917 Trans people have always used the bathroom/facilities of the gender they're living as. Conservatives just like discrimination and want to create potentially explosive situations. They seem to thrive on that in fact.
0:SB117 @Andrew917 Really, it's a distraction. Nobody in their right mind would think this was a problem.
0:1Jessie @SB117 @Andrew917 It's not, as long as it's not a law. A law saying that men can be in the ladies room, lets ALL men come in...that means rapists, and pedophiles. I've been in ladies rooms and noticed transgenders...they aren't what scares me...rapists and pedophiles do.
0:SB117 @1Jessie @SB117 @Andrew917 What law is saying that? What in the world are you talking about? All you're doing is confirming my point.
0:Andrew917 @1Jessie @SB117 @Andrew917 All men can already come in the women's bathroom. Most places have no law against that. The people trying to pass laws are the Republicans insisting that people use the bathroom of the gender on their birth certificate. So what laws are you talking about?
0:SB117 @Andrew917 @1Jessie @SB117 It's the same subset of people that think SCOTUS passed a "law" allowing SSM.
1:wayne230 @SB117 @Andrew917 @1Jessie THERE WERE 102 GAYS SHOT IN ORLANDO OVER THE GAY RULING WHERE WERE THEIR EQUAL RIGHTS?
0:SB117 It was over the ruling? Really? Source?
0:SB117 *crickets
1:wayne230 @SB117 sure all over the news the killer did it because of Sharia Law which is why the media deflected to his weapon. that showed what a LIE equal rights is
0:SB117 So, no source on your claim. Ok then.
0:rxwhitmer @Andrew917 NO they haven't and they'd better not. Not that I'd do anything about it, but there are a whole lot of people who would! Obama or no Obama. His legacy apparently is to be the President who has went against the will of the people who elected him more than anyone before him!
0:TurnHearts Has anyone heard if Bruce Springsteen, Ringo Starr, and other celebrities and corporations who condemned/boycotted NC are going to do the same to these other states? All I have heard is ..... crickets... Come on, where is the equality in your outrage, liberals? I can't hear you!
0:dusty911 @TurnHearts They haven't passed their Jim Crow laws yet.
1:wayne230 @dusty911 @TurnHearts You want slavery BACK that is why you want forced perversion you are calling that equality
0:SB117 @wayne230 @dusty911 @TurnHearts What forced perversion?
1:wayne230 @SB117 @wayne230 @dusty911 @TurnHearts which you push like mad I get so sick of the lie called equal rights
0:SB117 @wayne230 @SB117 @dusty911 @TurnHearts You didn't answer the question. What forced per⁠version? If you're sick of the nons⁠ense you make up, stop saying it.
0:wayne230 @SB117 @wayne230 @dusty911 @TurnHearts you never ASKED one you are making a statement and want compliance
0:SB117 @wayne230 @SB117 @dusty911 @TurnHearts For the third time; what forced perversion?
0:wayne230 @SB117 @wayne230 @dusty911 @TurnHearts and answer not desired
0:SB117 @wayne230 @SB117 @dusty911 @TurnHearts I didn't think so. All you know is the talking point on its face; you can't ever defend it.
0:wayne230 @SB117 @wayne230 @dusty911 @TurnHearts Your only point is forced compliance of perversion
0:SB117 @wayne230 @SB117 @dusty911 @TurnHearts Fourth time; What forced compliance of perversion?
0:mdr1975 @SB117 @wayne230 @dusty911 @TurnHearts Don't expect an answer to your question. I doubt you'll get one from him.
0:SB117 @mdr1975 @SB117 @wayne230 @dusty911 @TurnHearts I don't expect one. I'm hoping that he'll eventually realize he's a c⁠o⁠w⁠ard and s⁠h⁠u⁠t up.
0:wayne230 @mdr1975 @SB117 @wayne230 @dusty911 @TurnHearts because you are demanding COMPLIANCE or fines that is the only "answer" you will bother with
0:SB117 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @SB117 @dusty911 @TurnHearts Fines for what?
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @SB117 @dusty911 @TurnHearts I'm just pointing out that you haven't answered the first 3 times the question was asked, so don't expect an answer on the 4th time. 
0:SB117 @TurnHearts Who cares?
0:MollyPitcher1776 @TurnHearts Thats awsome! I hope the boycott ruins that states finances and the current AG becomes NCs next Govener.
1:wayne230 @MollyPitcher1776 @TurnHearts yep and your own kids will get raped by a pedophile in a shared bathroom then YOU will be crying. or will you? women have bodies in bedrooms but not bathrooms!
0:Tenniscourtoath @TurnHearts NC made itself the poster boy for this repulsive legislation which is why they are being singled out. Where is the conservative outage over Dennis Hastert, Mark Foley and Larry Craig? 
0:anniekaye @Tenniscourtoath @TurnHearts There was outrage over it. Didn't all of those men go to jail for their crimes? Has nothing to do with allowing someone to go into any bathroom of their choice.
0:rxwhitmer @TurnHearts These are celebrities? They are monkeys howlling at the moon! North Carolina has the right to make laws for their own state. Obama does NOT, and neither do any of your so called celebrities! What you and many others forget is that the United States of America is a collection of dependent states having their own morals and laws. Obama thinks that President means KING. It doesn't. It means limited leader. There are many things he cannot legally do, and this happens to be one of them!
0:DanielMaclean If states can ignore real federal laws and allow people to consume controlled substances for recreational usage, states can ignore imaginary federal laws and keep moving forward in a sane and rational way.
0:ch4101 @DanielMaclean I was thinking the same thing. Couldn't these states sue and claim why are some cities and states ignoring federal immigration laws
0:Atheoryoftime It's interesting that a law enforcement agency, the Executive Branch, can now order people to obey laws that don't exist. Cop pulls a guy over and says "Get out of that car, you are no longer allowed to drive". Guy says, "Why, what law did I break?" Cop says "My law, I'm ordering you to get out and never drive again." Guy says, "But . . . but . . . but . . . you can't do that, it's unconstitutional." Cops says "I just did it and if you don't obey you're going to jail." Guy says, "But why me?" Cop says "I don't like your hair cut".
