# OpenDTS
## Open Domestic Threat Scanner - Real-time sentiment analyzer and neighborhood alert system.



OpenDTS is a project that aims to provide a systematic and efficient way of identifying potential threats of extremist violence against minority groups in the United States. The project utilizes sentiment analysis to scan tweets and identify potential threats of violence, and a database to store and track these threats. 

The intention behind the creation of OpenDTS is to help neighborhoods across America prepare for real threats to their safety by providing actionable insights and early warning signs of potential extremist violence.
