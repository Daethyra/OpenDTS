# OpenDTS: Anomaly Detection System

OpenDTS is a cutting-edge anomaly detection system designed to identify potential domestic terror threats online in real-time. Leveraging the power of OpenAI's Ada-002 model, OpenDTS performs sentiment analysis and compares the results with a unique vector database hosted on Pinecone. This database comprises a comprehensive index of right-wing manifestos, instances of online bigotry, and more. The primary objective of OpenDTS is to predict if online posts indicate an intention to commit mass harm, thereby enhancing cybersecurity and threat detection capabilities. Additionally, OpenDTS can serve as a sentiment analysis service for organizations looking to harness the potential of large language models (LLMs). This project marks my first venture into the realm of LLMs and has been initiated from scratch, reflecting my commitment to independent learning and self-taught skills in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
