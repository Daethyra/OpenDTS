# OpenDTS: Real-Time Domestic Terrorism Threat Detector

TLDR: This project uses a multi-layered approach to predict whether or not someone, or some group is indicating the intention to commit mass harm. Only right-wing extremist groups are eligible for data processing. To predict indication of the intent to commit hate-based acts of violence.

OpenDTS (Domestic Threat Scanner) is a project intended to provide analytical insight into hostile sentiment towards a given demographic experiencing discrimination.

Users may create profiles to help them track sentiment towards one group.

## Developer's Thoughts

The application will do its best to accurately discern true intent to harm versus sarcasm, frustration without the intent to harm, and will make key decisions on multiple different layers comprised of entire models. Like the Ada-002 from OpenAI, for example.

Ideally, the first actual deployment will be a heatmap serving real-time processing data for whatever I choose.

- OpenDTS is the manifestation of my attempt to help others protect themselves
- I want it to be a comprehensive open-source cyberspace threat-intelligence platform
