It seems like you're at a very exciting stage of your project, where you're ready to transition from a prototype to a full-fledged service. Here's a roadmap and some guidance on how you can proceed:

## Step 1: Understanding Your Business Model

First, let's clarify the difference between PaaS (Platform as a Service) and SaaS (Software as a Service) in the context of your business.

- PaaS: If you provide an API endpoint for developers and they build their applications or services on top of your service, then it is more of a Platform as a Service. You are providing a platform (the threat detection service) upon which others can build their own software.

- SaaS: If end-users (non-technical) are directly using your service through a web dashboard, then it is a Software as a Service. You are providing a software (the threat detection dashboard) that end-users directly interact with.

In your case, you are actually providing both. Developers can use your API to integrate your service into their applications (PaaS), and non-technical users can use the web dashboard to interact with your service (SaaS).

## Step 2: Website Development and API Endpoints

For website development, you can leverage the WordPress template you've chosen. To make a front-facing site that sells your service, you'll need to clearly define:

- The problem you're solving (threat detection)
- How your service solves this problem (through sentiment analysis and threat tracking)
- Why your service is unique (use of advanced techniques, comprehensive approach)
- Pricing and packages, if applicable

For the API endpoint, you'll need to document the available API calls, the request and response formats, and any error messages. Good documentation is crucial for developers to effectively use your API.

## Step 3: Developing the Web Dashboard

For non-technical users, a web dashboard is a great way to visualize and interact with your service. The dashboard should be user-friendly and intuitive, displaying key information in an easy-to-understand format. You might want to display the threat data on a map, in charts, or in a list. This will require front-end web development skills, or you could use a dashboard tool or service.

## Step 4: Deployment

For deployment, you can use a cloud service provider like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. You might need multiple servers or instances: one for the API service, one for the dashboard, and one for the database. Make sure to properly configure security settings to protect your service and data. You might also need to scale your service as your user base grows, so consider auto-scaling solutions.

## Step 5: Marketing

Once your service is live, you'll need to attract users. This can be done through a variety of marketing strategies, including SEO (Search Engine Optimization), content marketing (blogs, articles, videos), social media marketing, and perhaps paid advertising. You should clearly communicate the value of your service and how it can help potential users.

Remember, this is a high-level roadmap and each step involves a lot of detail. Depending on your skills and resources, you might want to hire professionals for certain tasks like website design, API development, dashboard development, and marketing. Finally, make sure to get legal advice to understand any potential liabilities or legal requirements of providing this kind of service.
