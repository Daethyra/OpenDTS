### Collecting Information: 
- The project gathers information about potential threats from sources like social media posts and news articles.

### Analyzing the Information: 
- It uses advanced techniques to analyze the sentiment of these texts, which helps identify possible threats of violence.

### Storing the Information: 
- All of this information is then stored in a special kind of database, which is designed to handle a large amount of data and quickly access it when needed.

### Processing the Information: 
- The project uses a system that can efficiently handle and process all of the incoming data.

### Visualizing the Threats: 
- Finally, there are plans to develop a dashboard that visually represents the data, making it easier to understand the potential threats.

The main goal of this project is to give communities early warnings about potential violence, helping them prepare and protect themselves​1​.
